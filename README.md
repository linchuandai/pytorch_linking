# Pytorch in React Native
This is a sample project to show that Pytorch C++ can be used in React Native through Native UI Bridging.

## To build and run:
1. cd into base directory; npm install
2. cd into ios directory; pod install
3. run as an iOS app or use 'npx react-native run-ios'
Note: This requies an actual device since it requires the camera
